# Memory Game Project

Welcome to 'The Card Matching Game', a completely browser-based card matching game based on the popular memory game (Concentration).

#### How to Play 

* The player will click one card over to reveal its underlying icon.
* The player will then click on second card to turn over, trying to find the corresponding card with the same icon. 
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
